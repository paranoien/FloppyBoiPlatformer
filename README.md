This is my first platformer project in Unity. The game is currently in development for Windows, Mac and WebGL with mobile platforms planned in the future. This platformer features the ability to tap-fly similarly to Flappy Bird; however, the player has a limited number of jumps. The user gains new abilities as they progress and meets characters along the way. Character sprites are going to be changed in the future. Some current sprites are placeholders for development.
