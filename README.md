# FloppyBoiPlatformer

This is my first platformer project in Unity. The game is currently in development for Windows and Mac with mobile touch controls planned in the future. This platformer features the ability to tap fly similar to Flappy Bird; however, the user has a limited number of jumps. The user gains new abilities as they progress and meets characters along the way.
